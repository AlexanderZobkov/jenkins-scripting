jenkins-scripting
=================

This repository contains a Maven project that can help you to ease developing and learning of Jenkins groovy scripts.
* * *
This Maven project contains steps to compile groovy scripts and send them for execution to a Jenkins instance. This allows to automate such manual steps, that you do while developing or learning Jenkins scripts, as copy-pasting from some text editor to Jenkins script console (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Script+Console) and pushing "run" button. Additionally, if you would like to develop your jenkins groovy scripts or explore Jenkins API (http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/) with support of code completion or type inference features, open this Maven project in any IDE that supports Maven and Groovy. For example, Netbeans IDE (https://netbeans.org/) or Groovy/Grails tools suite (https://grails.org/products/ggts).
